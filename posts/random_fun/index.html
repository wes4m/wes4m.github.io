This first post is just laying out a possible timeline of the topics and ideas I will be going through and will later be updated to link the specific blog posts.\nFuzzing Not web applications fuzzing. I have always been interested in fuzzing. Whenever reading a writeup of some mind-blowing RCE the common entry point for that bug, or chain of bugs is usually fuzzing. I‚Äôve done some fuzzing but not enough. So ..\n Let‚Äôs build a fuzzer, or multiple fuzzers?, and incremntally optimize it.  Building a fuzzer will be fun, but what fun with no bugs. Before trying to choose a target. I wanted to re-discover a previously known exploitable CVE through fuzzing, Then, create an exploit for it.\n Re-discovering a bug, and writing an exploit for it.  At this point I‚Äôd hope that I‚Äôve made a few blog posts and gained a better understanding of fuzzers. Before continuing with fuzzers though, I will take a quick detour and comeback to them later.\nEmulation Emulation can be a very useful tool for fuzzing. As sometimes you want to fuzz a black-box target, a kernel, or something running on a different arch. However, this is just an execuse to make an emulator. I have always wanted to make an emulator for a simple archictucture.\n Making an emulator for something (NES?, idk will choose later).  I know that AFL has a QEMU mode (user only) for black-box targets. So while we‚Äôre at it with emulators. Let‚Äôs learn some stuff about QEMU, and maybe modify AFL to fuzz a binary running inside an emulated OS.\n Modify AFL, QEMU to fuzz a black-box target in a different OS (SerenityOS?)  I like SerenityOS and have learned a lot from Andreas Kling (@awesomekling) videos, so why not :D    Fuzzing part 2 (goal) in the second part of fuzzing, also known as finding a previously unknown exploitable bug through fuzzing (0-Day), and writing an exploit for it. I will try to do what it exactly says. I expect this to be the hardest part and I‚Äôm considering it a goal for 2021. The target doesn‚Äôt have to be big. The main reason I think this will be hard is because I struggle with choosing a target just for the sake of finding a bug. I usually find bugs in a target when I‚Äôm exploring it for a specific reason.\n Find a bug in ‚Äúsomething‚Äù through fuzzing, and write an exploit for it.  Hypervisors Just putting this one out here. I want to learn more about hypervisors and make a simple one.\n Making a hypervisor.   This is it for now.
